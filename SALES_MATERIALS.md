## Objection Handling

### "We already use [competitor]"
**Response**: "Taskflow doesn't just track tasks like other tools – it predicts bottlenecks and optimizes your team's execution. Our AI identifies which tasks will impact your critical deadlines most. Would you be interested in seeing how our predictive prioritization differs from what you're currently using?"

### "Too expensive for our budget"
**Response**: "Our enterprise customers report saving 10+ hours per week per team member through our AI insights and automation. The productivity gains typically pay for themselves within 2 months. We also offer flexible pricing based on your actual usage. Would you like to discuss a custom plan that fits your budget?"

### "Too complex for our team"
**Response**: "Taskflow is designed for simplicity. Your team can start using core features in minutes, with AI insights working automatically in the background. We provide comprehensive onboarding and training to ensure smooth adoption. What's your team's biggest challenge with current task management?"

### "We need to build our own solution"
**Response**: "Building an AI-powered task orchestration system with predictive analytics takes 6-12 months and requires ML expertise. Taskflow gives you enterprise-grade functionality immediately with ongoing innovation. This lets your team focus on your core product rather than infrastructure. What specific customization needs do you have that Taskflow doesn't address?"
